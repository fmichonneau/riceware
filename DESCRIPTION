Description: The Diceware method can be used to generate strong passphrases.
  In short, you roll a 6-faced dice 5 times in a row, the number obtained is
  matched against a dictionary of easily remembered word. Combining together 7
  words should be relatively easy to remember, but would take a few millions years
  (on average) for a powerful computer to guess.
Depends: R (>= 3.1.3)
